# Tiingo News Sentiment Analysis with DistilRoBERTa

This project integrates **QuantConnect‚Äôs Tiingo News data** with a **pretrained DistilRoBERTa financial sentiment model** to generate daily sentiment scores for SPY-related news.  
The output is a dataset of news articles (limited to 10 per day) with sentiment scores, plus a daily average sentiment index.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the Code Works

1. **QuantBook Setup**
   - Creates a `QuantBook` instance.
   - Adds **SPY equity** and **Tiingo News** as data sources.

2. **Data Retrieval**
   - Defines a time window (`2015-01-01` to `2025-08-30`).
   - Pulls historical Tiingo news articles linked to SPY.
   - Ensures timestamps are properly parsed as UTC datetimes.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Combines `title` and `description` into a single `text` field.
   - Limits to **10 articles per day** to avoid overweighting high-volume days.
   - Keeps only relevant columns: `date`, `time`, `title`, `description`, `text`.

4. **Sentiment Model**
   - Loads **DistilRoBERTa fine-tuned on financial news sentiment**:
     - Model: `mrm8488/distilroberta-finetuned-financial-news-sentiment-analysis`
   - Defines a scoring function:
     - Negative = -1  
     - Neutral = 0  
     - Positive = +1  
   - Applies the model to each article‚Äôs text.

5. **Daily Aggregation**
   - Computes the **average sentiment score per day** across all articles.

6. **Output**
   - Prints the full DataFrame of up to 10 articles per day with sentiment scores.
   - Provides a daily sentiment index (`daily_avg`).

## üìÇ Example Output Structure

### daily_sentiment_score.csv
| date       | time (UTC)         | title | description | text | sentiment_score |
|------------|--------------------|-------|-------------|------|-----------------|
| 2015-01-02 | 2015-01-02 14:30:00| ...   | ...         | ...  | -0.25           |
| 2015-01-02 | 2015-01-02 15:10:00| ...   | ...         | ...  | +0.80           |

### daily_average_sentiment_score.csv: 
| date       | sentiment_score |
|------------|-----------------|
| 2015-01-02 | 0.27            |
| 2015-01-05 | -0.12           |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes and Reminders

- **NaN / Empty Texts**: Articles with missing titles or descriptions are handled by filling with empty strings. If no text is available, sentiment defaults to `0` (neutral).
- **Daily Cap**: Only the first 10 articles per day are kept to avoid bias from high-volume news days.
- **Model Limitations**:
  - The sentiment model is trained on financial news but may misclassify nuanced or ambiguous headlines.
  - Scores are **continuous** between -1 and +1, but interpretation should be contextual.
- **Performance**: Running inference on large datasets may be slow without GPU acceleration.

## üìä Use Cases

- **Market Sentiment Index**: Use `daily_avg` as a proxy for investor mood around SPY.
- **Event Studies**: Align sentiment spikes with SPY returns or volatility.
- **Feature Engineering**: Incorporate sentiment scores into trading models alongside price/volume features.

## ‚úÖ Summary

This pipeline provides a **daily sentiment dataset** derived from SPY-related Tiingo news, scored with a **state-of-the-art NLP model**.  
It can be used for **quantitative research, trading strategies, or risk monitoring** where news sentiment is a key driver.
